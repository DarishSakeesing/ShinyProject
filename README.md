# The EV Revolution: Where is it?

## Problem
Electric Cars are vehicles that are powered, either fully or partially, by a battery instead of a traditional combustion engine. 
They are a powerful weapon in the fight against climate change as they cut carbon emissions almost completely. 
Moreover, they are cheaper to operate, as electric cars can be recharged for less than the cost to refuel a traditional car. Even so, 
the market has not responded well: electric cars have barely captured 1% of the market.

To understand the reasons, I analyzed the current state of the EV market and draw some conclusions as to why EVs haven't reached mass adoption yet.

## Tools Used
### Data
The data used in this analysis come from multiple sources. They are Statista, the US Department of Transport, InsideEVs.com and Evadoption.com
All preprocessing and transformations were done by me.

### Programming Language
The analysis is done in R and the app is using the shiny library. This library when used with others like shinydashboard, is powerful enough
to create an interactive web dashboard to present findings.
