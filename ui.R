          electric vehicles(EVs) in the United States and worldwide. EVs promise to make transport more accessible to
          everyone, dramatically reduce global carbon emissions, and be more green in general, and yet somehow, they have not
          been able to gain significant market share from combustion engine vehicles'),

        different capabilities that can accommodate different driversâ€™ needs. A major feature of EVs is that drivers can plug them in 
        to charge from an off-board electric power source. This distinguishes them from hybrid electric vehicles, which supplement an internal 
        combustion engine with battery power but cannot be plugged in.'),

          regenerative braking, which generates electricity from some of the energy normally lost when braking. Which type of vehicle will fit your 
          lifestyle depends on your needs and driving habits.'),

          golden zone that consumers want.'),

          not buying into the EV market. I can think of only two reasons why manufacturers do not produce
          cars in the golden zone: they have not figured out consumer demands yet, or they do not possess

          the charging network is not reliable enough to convince people to switch. As the plots have
          shown us, Tesla has been the main driving force for the EV industry and it could be that people
